Caption this image taken from an autonomous vehicle (referred to as the ego-vehicle). Our detection model classifies this object as {category}.  Here are the coordinates of the object {object_motion}. This is in the format [x, y, yaw, x_velocity, y_velocity, angular_velocity, distance].
This is in a coordinate system where positive x is to the front of the ego vehicle, positive y is to the left of the ego-vehicle, and positive z is above the ego-vehicle. Position and velocity are measured in meters and meters per second. Yaw is measured in degrees counter-clockwise (coloquially 'left') from the x-axis. Angular velocity is in degrees per second. Distance is distance from the ego-vehicle. 
Please describe the appearance of the object and scene, are located relative to the road/ego-vehicle, how they are moving, and how they are interacting with any nearby objects (if any are visible). 
Treat values of x, y, x_velocity, and y_velocity near zero as zero.
Do not mention yaw or angular velocity. 
Avoid using the words no and not. 
Avoid using numbers unless it is particularly relevant. 
Feel free to add more relevant information in the captions.

Here are some example captions for a given set of coordinates:

REGULAR_VEHICLE, [12.0, 13.0, 45.0, 4.4, 4.7, 10.0, 17.8]
The car 20 meters to the front left is making a left turn.

PEDESTRIAN, [-10.0, 0.3, 90.0, 0.0, -1.5, 0.0, 10.0]
The pedesestrian behind the ego-vehicle is walking from right to left.

TRUCK, [0.3, -5.0, 0.0, 0.2, -0.1, 0.1, 5.1]
The truck is stationary and parked to the right of the ego-vehicle.
